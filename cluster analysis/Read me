ClusterPlot.png is the results of a cluster analysis done in cluster 3.0 using the DiffExpr.txt dataset with the following settings:
filtering: % present >= 70; at least 1 observation with abs(val)>= 0.3. This resulted in 4314 genes passing out of 10188.
hierarchical: genes= cluster,  & similartity metric = correlation (uncentered); clustering method = centroid linkage
4 columns (arrays) were included, all were outputs from edgeR differential expression analysis. 
1) MGpost0 = ((groupMG.protein.14 + groupMG.protein.21 + groupMG.lipid.14 + groupMG.lipid.21)/4) - 
          ((groupControl.protein.14 + groupControl.protein.21 + groupControl.lipid.14 + groupControl.lipid.21)/4)
2) MGLpost0 = ((groupMG.lipid.14 + groupMG.lipid.21)/2) - ((groupControl.lipid.14 + groupControl.lipid.21)/2)
3) MGPpost0 = ((groupMG.protein.14 + groupMG.protein.21)/2) - ((groupControl.protein.14 + groupControl.protein.21)/2)
4) DietIfpost0 = ((groupMG.lipid.14 + groupMG.lipid.21)/2) - ((groupMG.protein.14 + groupMG.protein.21)/2)
The first column is sort of the addition of the middle two and the last is sort of the difference of the middle two

DiffExpr.cdt & DiffExpr.gtr are the outputs from cluster 3.0; DiffExpr.cdt is the one used in java tree view to make the heat map.

 cluster_chunks.csv is the list of genes from two chunks of the heat map where lipid and protein birds seem to be most different
 The Diet column says which chunk they come from. 
 1) ProtienUp is the chunk where most of the fold changes are postive in protein birds and negative in lipid birds
 2) LipidUp is the chunk where most of the fold changes are postive in lipid birds and negative in protein birds
 Gene descriptions are also included but I think adding GO eventually would be more helpful.
